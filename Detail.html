                          API stands for Application Programming Interface, which is a software 
                          agent that allows two applications to communicate. APIs are a simple way 
                          to extract and share data within and between organizations. APIs are 
                          everywhere. Every time you use a ridesharing app, send a payment, or 
                          change the temperature on your phone, you're using an API.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                        When you use one of the above apps, they connect to the Internet and send data to a server.The server then retrieves that data, interprets it, performs the necessary actions, and sends it back to your phone. The application then interprets that data and presents you with the information you wanted in a readable way.<br /><br />The term “API” has been generically used to describe connectivity interfaces to an application. However, over the years, the modern API has taken on some unique characteristics that have truly transformed the technology space. First, modern APIs adhere to specific standards (typically HTTP and REST), which enable APIs to be developer-friendly, self-described, easily accessible, and understood broadly.<br/><br />
                        <div><img src="\wt_cp\handtime-html\images\What_API.png" alt=""></div>
                        <b>Characteristics of API:</b>
                        <ul >
                            <li >APIs are treated more like products than code. They are designed for consumption for specific audiences (e.g. mobile developers), and they are documented and versioned in a way that enables users to have clear expectations of their maintenance and lifecycle.</li>
                            <li>APIs are more standardized, they can be monitored and managed for both performance and scale. And, most importantly, they have a much stronger discipline for <u>security and governance.</u></li>
                            <li>just like any other piece of software that is productized, the modern API has its own software development lifecycle (SDLC)-from mocking, designing, and testing to building, managing, and retiring. These APIs are well documented for both consumption and versioning in the process.</li>
                            <li>Today, APIs have become so valuable that they comprise a large part of many business revenue. For example, on average, 35% of organizations revenue is now generated by APIs and related implementations. These companies are contributing to a marketplace of thousands of APIs, otherwise referred to as the API economy.</li>
                         </ul>
                        </p>
                        <p >
                          <b>Role of API:</b><br />Companies are digitally transforming faster than ever to keep up with their competitors and increase customer demands. APIs help them digitize, connect, and innovate across their products and services. APIs are a key enabler of these efforts. In fact, 90% of executives say that APIs are mission-critical to their businesses. By adopting API-driven strategies, they can drive growth and innovation. Incorporating APIs into business operations can help:
                          <ul>
                            <li >Simplify and accelerate their go-to-market strategies</li>
                            <li >Enhance customer experiences</li>
                            <li >Improve operational agility and speed</li>
                            <li >Develop and pursue new revenue, market, and channel opportunities</li>
                            <li >Data Retrieval and Integration: APIs allow web developers to retrieve data from various sources such as databases, web services, or external APIs. For example, social media platforms provide APIs that developers can use to access user profiles, posts, or perform actions like posting on behalf of a user.</li>
                            <li >Service Integration: APIs facilitate the integration of third-party services into web applications. This can include payment gateways, geolocation services, messaging services, or cloud storage. By utilizing APIs, developers can enhance the functionality and capabilities of their web applications without having to build everything from scratch.</li>
                            <li >Content Delivery: APIs enable developers to integrate content from external sources into their web applications. For instance, news websites can utilize APIs to display real-time headlines or weather information on their pages, leveraging the data provided by external sources.</li>
                            <li >Mobile and Cross-Platform Development: APIs play a crucial role in mobile and cross-platform development. Mobile apps can utilize APIs to interact with web services, access device functionalities like cameras or location, and synchronize data across multiple platforms.</li>
                            <li >Backend and Frontend Communication: APIs enable communication between the backend and frontend components of web applications. The backend exposes APIs that define the available endpoints and data formats, allowing the frontend to make requests and receive responses. This separation of concerns allows for modular development and easier collaboration between frontend and backend teams.</li>
                            <li >Microservices Architecture: APIs are essential in a microservices architecture, where applications are divided into smaller, independent services. APIs enable these services to communicate and share data, creating a flexible and scalable architecture.
                            </li>
                          </ul>
                       </p>
                       <p >
                           <b>Types of API:</b><br>APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) can be classified into different types based on their functionality and usage. Here are some common types of APIs:
                           <ol>
                               <li ><p style="font-size: 22;">APIs (HTTP/RESTful APIs):</p>
                                   <p > Web APIs, also known as HTTP APIs or RESTful APIs, are a popular type of API used to interact with web services over the internet. They use standard HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.) to perform operations on resources and typically exchange data in formats like JSON or XML. Web APIs are widely used for integrating third-party services into web applications, mobile apps, and other software.</p>
                                   <div><img src="\wt_cp\handtime-html\images\apidiagram.jpeg" alt=""></div>
                               </li>
                               <li><p style="font-size: 22;">SOAP APIs (Simple Object Access Protocol):</p>
                                   <p >SOAP APIs use the XML-based messaging protocol called SOAP for communication. They are more rigid and require XML for data exchange. SOAP APIs are commonly used in enterprise-level applications and scenarios where strict security and reliability are critical.</p>
                                   <div><img src="\wt_cp\handtime-html\images\soap_api.jpg" alt=""></div>
